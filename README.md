### OPTIONS:  

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoFazioRandom/Virtual-Joystick-Godot/master/preview_2.png" width="300">

- Joystick mode: 
	- Fixed: The joystick doesn't move. 
	- Dynamic: Every time the joystick area is pressed, the joystick position is set on the touched position. 
	- Following: If the finger moves outside the joystick background, the joystick follows it.  

- Vector mode: 
	- Real: return a vector with a lenght beetween 0 and 1; useful for implementing different velocity or acceleration.  
	- Normalized: return a normalized vector. 

- Directions: The number of directions, e.g. a D-pad is joystick with 4 directions, keep 0 for a free joystick.  
- Simmetry Angle: the angle of simmetry of the directions.  

- Dead zone: If the handle is inside this range, in proportion to the background size, the output is zero.

- Clamp zone: The max distance the handle can reach, in proportion to the background size.

- Visibility mode: 
	- Always: Always visible.
	- touchscreen only: Visible on touch screens only (will hide() if the device has not a touchscreen).

### HELP:  
- The Control parent of the joystick is the area in which the joystick can move in Dynamic or Following mode.  
- For moving the joystick inside is area, select it, right click and turn on "Editable Children" and simply move the 'Background' node.  - With "Editable Children" turned on you can also edit the joystick textures and colors.  
- An example scene is provided in the "Test" folder.  
- To be able to use the joystick with the mouse, you have to go to Project settings -> Input Devices -> Pointing, and turn on the option "emulate touch from mouse".  

### ADVICE ON HOW TO USE:  
Create a CanvasLayer node and name it "UI", it'll contain all the UI elements, then add the Joystick scene as a child of the UI node and move it where you prefer (remember to turn on "Editable Children").
